Data generation for Blanc et al. model.

```{r define}
# number of sites in the study
nsites <- 4

# number of individuals in capture history
n <- 10

# number of sampling occasions in capture-recapture
nsample_cap <- 5

# number of sampling occasions in presence-absence
nsample_occ <- 7

# capture probability
p <- 0.5

# occupancy probability
occupancy <- 0.3
```


# Simulate Individuals

```{r individuals}
set.seed(1234)
# our study area is the unit square

# define homerange centers

# Poisson process, with x, y coordinates as independent uniform
# random variables

homeranges <- array(data = NA, dim = c(n, 2), dimnames = list(c(1:n), c("x", "y")))

for (i in 1:n) {
  x <- runif(1)
  y <- runif(1)
  homeranges[i, 1] <- x
  homeranges[i, 2] <- y
}

# plotting homeranges for validation
par(pty = "s")
plot(homeranges)
```

# Presence-Absence Data

```{r presence-absence}

# We now have a m x m grid for the unit square as our divided area

# number of grid cells per row
m <- 4
```
